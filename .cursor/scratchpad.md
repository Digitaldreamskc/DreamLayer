# DreamLayer Project Planning

## Background and Motivation
DreamLayer is a Solana dApp focused on event check-ins and digital badges. We're currently facing issues with Privy wallet integration in Next.js 15.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- ‚úÖ Basic Next.js project setup with TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS integration
- ‚úÖ Basic landing page layout with navigation grid
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Wallet connection (Privy integration issues)
- ‚úÖ Gradient background styling
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Immediate Priorities (Before UI/UX Improvements)
1. **Fix Directory Structure**
   - [ ] Ensure all commands run in correct directory (`~/DreamLayer/dreamlayer`)
   - [ ] Verify package.json location
   - [ ] Clean up any misplaced node_modules

2. **Environment Setup**
   - [ ] Create proper `.env.local` file
   - [ ] Document all required environment variables
   - [ ] Create `.env.example` file

3. **Authentication Implementation**
   - [ ] Remove Manifold Connect
   - [ ] Implement Privy wallet connection for Solana
   - [ ] Add loading states for wallet connection
   - [ ] Add error handling for connection failures
   - [ ] Implement proper authentication state management

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Privy Integration Issues**
   - Error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'privyWalletOverride')`
   - Error: `ChunkLoadError` in webpack
   - These suggest version compatibility issues between Next.js 15 and Privy

2. **Root Causes**
   - Version mismatch between Next.js 15 and Privy
   - Incorrect Privy configuration
   - Build cache issues
   - Potential dependency conflicts

## High-level Task Breakdown

2. [ ] Configure Privy Correctly
   - [ ] Update ClientLayout.tsx with minimal configuration
   - [ ] Add proper environment variables
   - [ ] Test basic wallet connection
   - [ ] Add Solana chain configuration
   - [ ] Test full wallet functionality

3. [ ] Implement Error Handling
   - [ ] Add error boundaries

- Need to test wallet connection after configuration changes

## Lessons
- Always verify working directory before running commands
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper loading states for better UX
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Use proper semantic HTML for better accessibility
- Choose wallet connection solutions that have native support for the target blockchain (Solana in this case)
- When facing dependency issues, try older, more stable versions first
- Clear build caches when experiencing webpack errors

# Solana dApp Scaffold Project

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a full-stack Solana dApp scaffold that integrates modern web technologies and blockchain functionality. The application will serve as a foundation for building interactive experiences with wallet authentication, NFT minting capabilities, and social features.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Issues
1. **Directory Structure Confusion**
   - Commands are being executed in `~/DreamLayer` instead of `~/DreamLayer/dreamlayer`
   - This is causing dependencies to be installed in the wrong location
   - The error messages show paths like `C:\Users\Junipers\DreamLayer\node_modules` instead of `C:\Users\Junipers\DreamLayer\dreamlayer\node_modules`

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - React and React DOM are not properly installed
   - Privy package is missing
   - TypeScript dependencies are needed

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Error: `EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Users\Junipers\DreamLayer\.next\trace'`
   - Unable to remove `.next` directory: `rm: cannot remove '.next': Directory not empty`

4. **Port Conflicts**
   - Port 3000 is in use
   - Server is trying to use ports 3001 and 3002

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Directory Structure**
   - The project has a nested structure: `DreamLayer/dreamlayer`
   - All commands are being executed in the parent directory
   - This explains why dependencies aren't being found and installed correctly

2. **Shell Environment**
   - Using Git Bash on Windows
   - Some commands are failing with `[200~npm: command not found`
   - Permission issues with file operations
